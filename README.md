React+Node Fullstack Developer Practical Test
Welcome! This practical task assesses your skills with React and Node.js. Follow these
instructions carefully, use best practices, modern JavaScript/TypeScript, clear commit
messages, and provide a detailed README.md. Good luck!

Requirements:
● Use a public GitHub repository, named Fullstack-React-Node-Test.
● Include the instructions provided here in your README.md.
● Use separate branches for each task (e.g., tasks/task-1, etc.). Merge branches to
main after completion without deleting original branches.

Task 1: Project Setup
● Set up the project structure for readability and maintainability.
● Initialize React frontend using Vite or CRA (Create React App).
● Setup Node.js backend with Express.

Task 2: REST API Creation
● Implement a CRUD API for a "Task" entity (fields: id, title, description, status).
● Use SQLite or PostgreSQL as your database.
● Document the API endpoints in your README.md.

Task 3: Frontend Development
● Connect the React frontend to your Node.js backend.
● Implement frontend views/components to list, add, edit, and delete tasks.
● Add basic CSS or use a UI library like Tailwind, Bootstrap, or Material UI for styling.

Task 4: Form Validation
● Implement form validation on the frontend for the task creation/edit forms.
● Provide clear user feedback on validation errors.

Task 5: Authentication
● Add simple user authentication to the app (registration, login, logout).
● Protect CRUD API endpoints to require authentication.
● Document authentication mechanism clearly in your README.md.

Task 6: Docker & Environment
● Dockerize the app using Docker Compose.
● Securely manage environment variables with .env file.

Task 6: Testing
● Write Jest tests for the backend APIs.
● Write Jest and React Testing Library tests for frontend components.
● Include testing instructions in your README.md.

Final Notes
Ensure all tasks are thoroughly completed, your code is clear, maintainable, and
well-documented. We look forward to reviewing your submission!
Thank you!
